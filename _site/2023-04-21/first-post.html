  <h2 class="post-title">Reflections on Research, Plans for Summer 2023</h2>
  <div class="post-line"></div>

  <h2 id="hello-world">Hello World</h2>
<p>Just this last month, I wrote my first ever research proposal.</p>

<p>Recently, I was awarded my first ever official research fellowship in the form of UCSF’s <strong><a href="https://meded.ucsf.edu/fund-opportunity/summer-explore-research-fellowship">Summer Explore</a></strong> grant. For 7 weeks this coming summer, I’ll be examining the use of tract-specific fractional anisotropy to predict deep brain stimulation outcomes in Parkinson’s Disease.</p>

<h2 id="reflections">Reflections</h2>
<p>Writing a research proposal from scratch should sound like a daunting task for any undergraduate or new grad just beginning an M.D. or Ph.D. program. I know it sounded like one for me. I’d always (wrongly) assumed throughout my undergraduate years that by working as a cog in the wheel, someone would eventually take the time to walk me through the grant-writing process. After all, I <em>was</em> a contributing member of a research laboratory that had made publication a goal for all of our projects.</p>

<p>If I could go back in time, I would’ve lectured myself about how in academia insomuch as in the real world, <strong>never assume important skills will be taught to you if you haven’t actively positioned yourself to gain them</strong>. In research, for instance, the onus is on you to demonstrate to your mentors your ability to provide utility beyond the unloading of a pipette or the running of a gel for SDS-PAGE. Doing lab work certainly benefits your mentors, but ask yourself this: are the skills that you gain from doing that of similar benefit to you? By becoming content with performing routine laboratory tasks, you are providing a valuable resource (time) while receiving very little transferable skill in return. In the worst case as an undergraduate, you risk losing sight of arguably one of the most important skills for research: academic writing.</p>

<p><strong>Some things I now wish I had done while doing research in college:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Apply to lots of research fellowships.</strong> People are incentivized to help you when they can also benefit from your success. Having someone in your lab awarded a research fellowship increases the prestige of the laboratory and also makes it more likely that you’ll be contributing meaninfully to an ongoing projects. Plenty of research fellowships exist for undergraduates that you can apply to. When the time comes around, ask your postdoc or PI to help revise your application, which will normally resemble a research proposal in some way.</li>
  <li><strong>Ask to help with manuscript writing.</strong> While helping out in a wet lab will help you get published, nothing is more important to publication than the actually writing of the manuscript. In the early stages of your research career, your goal shouldn’t be to become familiar with whatever technologies the lab uses (which are often highly specific to that particular lab and won’t translate well to other research), but rather to become more familiar with the process behind getting research successfully published. Don’t think that simply running experiments for a wet lab will be of significant benefit to you in the long run, especially if you’re planning on a career in medicine.</li>
  <li><strong>Actively communicate your goals to your mentors.</strong> I don’t fault my mentors for never teaching me these skills. Why? Because I had never demonstrated the initiative to ask. In retrospect, proposing new research ideas within the lab and requesting to be taught how to write for research would have prepared me much better for research as a medical student. My mentors also had no idea I wanted to go to medical school and probably took me in thinking I’d pursue a Ph.D. in Biochemistry.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that I’ve actually written a proposal to do research, I realize that for most students, the “first” research proposal won’t be from scratch at all. Unless you’re spearheading a completely new study on your own (you’re probably not), plenty of resources should exist to go off of including your mentor’s NIH grant, fellowship applications written by other students in your lab, and example research proposals provided by your school.</p>

<p>Similar to many hurdles in life, the hardest part of writing a research grant was the act of getting started.</p>

<h2 id="this-summers-project">This Summer’s Project</h2>

<p>Here’s the abstract from my grant proposal that sums up what I’ll be working on fairly well:</p>

<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a highly effective neurosurgical
treatment option for alleviation of Parkinson’s disease (PD)
symptoms that selectively confers favorable outcomes in some
patients over others. Despite the widespread use of DBS as a
second-line therapy for PD patients, there remains a lack of
evidence supporting the validity of specific clinical predictors
for DBS success. This serves as a barrier in the identification of
PD patients suitable for DBS therapy. Fractional anisotropy (FA)
derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is among the most
common MRI biomarkers of white matter microstructure in
diffusion MRI studies of neurodevelopment, brain aging, and
neurologic injury. It is regularly collected for PD patients who
undergo DBS therapy and thus has potential for serving as an
effective predictor for DBS response.</p>

<p>This project will assess and compare the predictive power of
tract-specific FA values for DBS outcomes in PD patients, which
can be approximated by pre- to post-operative difference in
patients’ daily PD medication dose. We will use DTI data and
outcome measures from 150 PD patients who underwent DBS
at UCSF. A novel segmentation method called automated fiber
quantification (AFQ) will be used to create a pipeline for
retrieving FA values of the corticospinal and
dentatorubrothalamic tracts, both of which are involved in PD
motor dysfunction. Through preserving diffusion measurement
information along white matter tracts, AFQ offers more
granularity than standard DTI analysis methods, allowing for
more comprehensive investigation of the relationship between
brain tissue integrity and DBS outcomes than was previously
possible.</p>

<h2 id="plans">Plans</h2>
<p>All of my ongoing research projects are fortunately compatible with remote work, so my summer will involve some traveling. I’ll be in Colombia (Medellín, San Andrés, Cartagena) from late July to early August. Still exploring which countries to travel to over the rest of the summer, but high on my list are countries with reasonable costs of living including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Thailand</li>
  <li>Cambodia</li>
  <li>Romania</li>
  <li>Argentina</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re reading this and have any suggestions to offer, let me know!</p>
