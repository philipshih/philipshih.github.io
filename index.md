# About Me
Working on acquiring skills to make healthcare more efficient and interoperable. 

M.D., M.S. Candidate @ [The Joint Medical Program](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/academics/joint-medical-program/). Cal alum.
<br/>

# Research
I am currently conducting research in the [Morrison Lab](https://morrisonlab.ucsf.edu/) at UCSF. 

In the past, I was part of the [Klinman Group](http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/jukgrp/klinman_group/Home.html) and [ULab](https://ulab.berkeley.edu/labs/bio) at Berkeley.

# Interests
I am broadly interested in applications of statistical learning in medicine and public health. 

I enjoy finding ways to automate things and minimize redundancy.

I [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/108682054-philip-shih) about technology, anthropology, geopolitics, and the future.

You can find me playing [Forum Mafia](https://www.sc2mafia.com/forum/) or [hiking](https://www.alltrails.com/members/philip-shih-2?ref=header) in San Francisco and the East Bay.
