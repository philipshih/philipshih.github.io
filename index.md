# Research
I am currently conducting research in the [Morrison Lab](https://morrisonlab.ucsf.edu/) at UCSF.

# Interests
I am broadly interested in applications of statistical learning in medicine and public health. 

I like to automate things and minimize redundancy.

I [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/108682054-philip-shih) about science, medicine, philosophy, politics, and futurism.

You can find me playing [Forum Mafia](https://www.sc2mafia.com/forum/) or [hiking](https://www.alltrails.com/members/philip-shih-2?ref=header) in San Francisco and the East Bay.
