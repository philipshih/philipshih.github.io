# About Me
Cal alum. Medical student at [UCSF School of Medicine](https://medschool.ucsf.edu/). 
<br/>

# Research
I received my M.S. from the [UC Berkeley-UCSF Joint Medical Program](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/academics/joint-medical-program), focused on clinical image processing. My thesis was "Tract-Specific Fractional Anisotropy Improves DBS Outcome Prediction in Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Over Clinical Predictors Alone".

In the past, I was part of the [Klinman Group](http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/jukgrp/klinman_group/Home.html) and [ULab](https://ulab.berkeley.edu/labs/bio) at Berkeley.
<br/>

# Interests
My primary research interests are in imaging tools, methods, and generation of synthetic data for improving the performance of clinical decision support systems.
