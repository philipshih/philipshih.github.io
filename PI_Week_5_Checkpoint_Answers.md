# Physician Identity Week Checkpoint - Week 5 Responses (Concise)

## 1. How has your identity as a future physician changed since medical school and clerkships? What will you keep doing, start doing, and/or stop doing for professional development?

My physician identity has evolved from an abstract concept to a more tangible role shaped by patient interactions and clinical reasoning during clerkships. I've shifted from primarily a knowledge-acquirer to an empathetic caregiver beginning to apply that knowledge.

**Keep doing:** Active listening to patients, consistently seeking feedback, and reflective practice.
**Start doing:** Deeper learning around patient presentations, mentoring junior students when possible, and intentionally developing physician wellness habits.
**Stop doing:** Fearing "silly" questions, comparing my journey to others, and over-relying on purely analytical thinking without trusting developing intuition (while still verifying).
My identity is now a dynamic process of "becoming," not a static endpoint.

## 2. Choose one session from PI Week 5, identify one learning point, and describe its impact.

**Session:** "Ambiguity & Uncertainty in Medicine" (PIF 5)
**Learning Point:** A critical learning point was that "Uncertainty itself can expose bias: when things are less clear, people may unconsciously default to stereotypes for quick decision-making." Additionally, diseases are often described as they present in dominant groups, potentially increasing uncertainty and bias when caring for patients from marginalized groups.
**Impact on Care:** This understanding will make me more vigilant during clerkships, especially in ambiguous clinical situations. I will consciously question if uncertainty is leading to stereotype-based assumptions, particularly with patients from marginalized backgrounds. I'll strive to seek more information or consult diverse resources before settling on a diagnostic or treatment path, aiming for more equitable care.
**Impact on Identity:** This shapes my identity by instilling a commitment to critically examine my own decision-making processes under uncertainty. It reinforces the "Physician as Advocate" role, pushing me to be aware of and actively mitigate potential biases to ensure all patients receive fair and evidence-based care, regardless of how their presentation aligns with "classic" textbook descriptions.

## 3. What self-directed activity did you participate in during PI Week 5? What themes were relevant, and how did it impact your identity? How will your focus shift?

**Self-Directed Activity:** Deep-dive into current research and emerging treatments in Dermatology, focusing on immunodermatology.
**Relevant Themes:** Lifelong Learner (proactive, advanced learning), Career Explorer (engaging with specialty substance), Professional (connecting to the broader scientific community).
**Impact on Identity:** Solidified identity as a proactive, curious learner and future physician-scientist, boosting confidence and connection to Dermatology as an intellectual discipline.
**Focus Shift:** More focused exploration within specialties of interest, proactive mentorship seeking, integrating advocacy considerations into career exploration, and developing a personal learning portfolio.

## 4. What career paths/specialties interest you most? Review AAMC Careers in Medicine. What did you learn? List 3 ways to explore/confirm interest.

**Most Interested Specialty:** Dermatology.
**AAMC CiM Learnings (Conceptual):** Confirmed Dermatology's breadth (medical, surgical, pediatric, dermatopathology), its visual/diagnostic nature, potential for continuity of care, and its competitive landscape. It involves a good mix of medical management and procedures.
**3 Ways to Explore/Confirm Interest:**
1.  **Seek Dermatology Research:** Engage in a research project to understand the academic side and work with faculty.
2.  **Diverse Shadowing:** Shadow in various dermatology settings (academic, private, sub-specialties) for a holistic view.
3.  **Connect with Residents/Fellows:** Discuss their training experiences, challenges, and advice for interested students.
