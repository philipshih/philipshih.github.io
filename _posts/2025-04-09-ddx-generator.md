This tool demonstrates how a differential diagnosis list can be dynamically generated based on user input. Select patient findings (age, history, physical exam) using the expandable sections and checkboxes, and the tool will suggest potential diagnoses (with examples for rash, chest pain, and shortness of breath) with illustrative likelihoods and basic plans.

**Disclaimer:** This is a portfolio demonstration project ONLY, using a highly simplified knowledge base. It is NOT a real medical tool and must NOT be used for actual diagnosis or treatment decisions.
