Made this to demonstrate how a differential diagnoses can be dynamically generated based on user input. Select patient findings (age, history, physical exam across multiple systems) using the expandable sections and checkboxes. The tool uses a simplified knowledge base and scoring logic to suggest potential diagnoses with illustrative likelihoods and basic plans. The knowledge base includes examples covering Skin, Chest Pain, Shortness of Breath, GI, MSK, and Neurological presentations.

This is a portfolio demonstration project ONLY, using a highly simplified knowledge base. It is NOT a real medical tool so do NOT use this for actual diagnosis or treatment decisions.
