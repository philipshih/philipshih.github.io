Related to some of my ongoing research. The Vision Sandbox lets you upload an image, apply various augmentation techniques (rotation, scaling, brightness, contrast, noise, blur, shear), crop the image, and see it classified in real-time using a pre-trained MobileNet model (TensorFlow.js). Image details (resolution, type) are displayed, and a watermark is added. You can explore how augmentations and cropping affect the image and classification.
