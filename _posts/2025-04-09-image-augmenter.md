This interactive tool allows users to upload an image, apply various augmentation techniques (rotation, scaling, brightness, contrast, noise, blur, shear), and see the image classified in real-time using a pre-trained MobileNet model running directly in the browser via TensorFlow.js. Explore how augmentations affect the image and potentially the classification output.
