## Hello World
I recently wrote my first ever research proposal and was awarded my first ever official research fellowship in the form of my medical school's Summer Explore grant. Over the summer, my project will be examining the potential use of tract-Specific fractional anisotropy to predict deep brain stimulation outcomes in Parkinson's Disease.

## Reflections
Writing a research proposal from scratch likely sounds like a daunting task, especially for an undergraduate or a new grad just beginning an M.D. or Ph.D. program. I'd always (wrongly) assumed throughout my undergraduate years that someone would eventually walk me through the grant-writing process, especially since I was a contributing member of a research laboratory that had made publication a goal for most of our ongoing projects.

I had to learn the hard way that in academia insomuch as the real world, it's unlikely anyone will go out of their way to hold your hand unless you're able to bring value to them or some way. Don't just assume these skills will be taught to you - the onus is on you to show your postdoc or PI that you can provide utility beyond the unloading of a pipette or running a gel electrophoresis. Because I had always been content with my role helping with these tasks, I was never able to pick up the skills I needed to contribute to manuscript writing: one of the most important roles in getting a research project published and arguably one of the most useful skills you can have as a medical student. 

Some ways that you can do this:
- **Apply to a research fellowship.** Faculty are incentivized to help you when they benefit from your success. Having someone in your lab awarded a research fellowship increases the prestige of the laboratory and also makes it more likely that you'll be contributing meaninfully to an ongoing projects. Plenty of research fellowships exist for undergraduates that you can apply to. When the time comes around, ask your postdoc or PI to help revise your application, which will normally resemble a research proposal in some way.
- **Ask to help with manuscript writing** While helping out in a wet lab will help you get published, nothing is more important to publication than the actually writing of the manuscript. In the early stages of your research career, your goal shouldn't be to become familiar with whatever technologies the lab uses (which are often highly specific to that particular lab), but rather to become more familiar with the process behind getting research successfully published. Don't think that running experiments for a wet lab will be of significant benefit to you in the long run, especially if you're planning on a career in medicine.
- **Actively communicate your goals to your mentors** I don't fault my mentors for never teaching me these skills because I not only had never asked, but also had no idea they were important. In retrospect, asking specifically about learning how to write for research as well as proposing new ideas within the lab to write about would have resulted in my being much more comfortable in writing a proposal. My mentors also had no idea I wanted to go to medical school, and probably took me in thinking I wanted to pursue a Ph.D. in Biochemistry.

Now that I've actually written a proposal from scratch, I realize that your first research proposal likely won't be from scratch at all. Plenty of resources exist for you to go off of, including your mentor's NIH grant, fellowship applications written by other students in your lab, and example research proposals provided by your school. Just like a lot of other hurdles in life, the hardest part of learning how to write a research grant is the process of getting started. 

## Plans
My research project is remote-ready so my summer will involve some traveling. I'll be in Colombia (Medellín, San Andrés, Cartagena) from late July to early August. Still exploring which countries to travel to over the rest of my summer, but high on my list are countries with more reasonable costs of living including:

- Thailand
- Cambodia
- Argentina
- Romania
