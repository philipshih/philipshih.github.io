# PI Week 5: SMARTIE Goals

## Professional Development Goal

**What is an area, or areas, you would like to work on by setting learning goals?**

I aim to improve my differential diagnosis skills and understanding of first-line treatments for 5 common conditions each in Psychiatry, Dermatology, Radiology, and Ophthalmology.

**Why is this a priority for you?**

This is a priority because it will help me to better understand and compare these specialties I am interested in, aiding in informed career choices and enhancing my learning and performance during F2 clerkships.

**What feedback or information do you have about how you are doing in this area(s)? If you have not received feedback about your performance in this area, how might you get more information?**

My current knowledge varies across these fields. I will gain more information by studying at least one text and two example cases for each of the four specialties by the middle of my F2 clerkship year, and by discussing concepts with preceptors when opportunities arise.

**SMARTIE Goal 1: Broadening Foundational Knowledge in Key Specialties**

*   **S:** Improve DDx & 1st-line Rx for 5 common conditions each in Psych, Derm, Rads, Ophtho.
*   **M:** Study 1 text & 2 cases/specialty. Self-assess understanding of key features/treatments.
*   **A:** Achievable by dedicating focused study blocks for each specialty.
*   **R:** Helps better understand/compare specialties for career choice & clerkship performance.
*   **T:** By mid-F2 clerkship year.
*   **I:** Note varied presentations/implications in diverse populations & cultural contexts.
*   **E:** Consider access to care/imaging & systemic factors affecting outcomes in these areas.

## Learning Goal 2 (Paragraph Form)

**What is an area, or areas, you would like to work on by setting learning goals?**

I will aim to improve my differentials and understanding of first line treatments for 5 of the most common conditions in specialties related to my interest in imaging, including psychiatry, dermatology, radiology, ophthalmology.

**Why is this a priority for you?**

This will help me better compare specialties for career choice and clerkship performance. It will also allow me to build an understanding of how access to care/imaging and systemic factors may affect outcomes in these areas, particularly for marginalized groups.

**What feedback or information do you have about how you are doing in this area(s)? If you have not received feedback about your performance in this area, how might you get more information?**

My current knowledge varies. For each specialty, I will study at least 1 text and 2 example cases, including at least one focused on a marginalized group in healthcare, by the middle of my F2 clerkship year to achieve this. I will also discuss concepts with preceptors.

**SMARTIE Goal 2: Exploring Specialties via Common Conditions & Health Equity**

*   **S:** Improve DDx/Rx (5 common conditions) in Psych, Derm, Rads, Ophtho (imaging interest).
*   **M:** Study 1 text & 2 cases (1 on marginalized group)/specialty. Self-assess understanding.
*   **A:** Achievable with focused study blocks per specialty.
*   **R:** Better compare specialties, enhance clerkship performance, understand health equity factors.
*   **T:** By mid-F2 clerkship year.
*   **I:** Include cases focusing on marginalized groups for each specialty.
*   **E:** Build understanding of access/systemic factors affecting outcomes for diverse groups.

## Learning Goal 3: Career Exploration with Advisors and Mentors

**What is an area, or areas, you would like to work on by setting learning goals?**

I aim to actively engage with career advisors and mentors to gain deeper insights into specialties of interest (Psychiatry, Dermatology, Radiology, Ophthalmology) and understand pathways to successfully match into them.

**Why is this a priority for you?**

Making an informed specialty choice and preparing a competitive residency application requires guidance from experienced individuals. Their advice on research, networking, and application strategy is invaluable for my long-term career planning.

**What feedback or information do you have about how you are doing in this area(s)? If you have not received feedback about your performance in this area, how might you get more information?**

I have general information about these specialties but lack personalized advice. I will schedule meetings with at least one career advisor and one mentor for two of my top specialty choices to discuss my profile and gather specific recommendations.

**SMARTIE Goal 3: Leveraging Advisors/Mentors for Career Pathway Guidance**

*   **S:** Meet 1 career advisor & 1 mentor for 2 top specialties (Psych, Derm, Rads, Ophtho) to discuss career paths & application strategies.
*   **M:** Document key advice & 2-3 actionable steps per specialty.
*   **A:** Achievable by scheduling 2-4 meetings over next 2-3 months.
*   **R:** Crucial for informed specialty choice & competitive application prep.
*   **T:** Complete meetings & document steps within 3 months.
*   **I:** Ask about experiences of mentors from diverse backgrounds & advice for URM applicants.
*   **E:** Discuss how to address potential biases in selection & highlight commitment to equity.
